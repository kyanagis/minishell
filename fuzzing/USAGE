Minishell fuzzing quickstart (AFL++)

1) Build with AFL instrumentation
   make fuzz-build AFL_CC=afl-gcc

2) Prepare corpus seeds and dictionary
   make fuzz-setup

3) (Optional) Minimize seeds against current binary
   make fuzz-min

4) Run fuzzing
   make fuzz AFL_CC=afl-gcc

Directory layout
- fuzzing/corpus/in: initial curated seed corpus
- fuzzing/corpus/min: minimized corpus (afl-cmin output)
- fuzzing/corpus/out: afl-fuzz output
- fuzzing/minishell.dict: AFL dictionary for shell tokens/builtins

Scripts
- fuzzing/scripts/prepare_seeds.sh [out_dir]
- fuzzing/scripts/gen_dictionary.sh [out_file]
- fuzzing/scripts/minimize_seeds.sh [in_dir] [out_dir]
- fuzzing/scripts/run_afl.sh [in_dir] [out_dir] [dict_file]

Tips
- Use one terminal per fuzzer instance and share the same out directory.
- For long runs, start with -m none if the target is memory heavy.
- Keep seed files small and diverse; prefer syntax coverage over size.
